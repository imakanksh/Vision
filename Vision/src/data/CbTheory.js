      "Color Blindness is the decreased ability to see differences in colors. Color blindness is also known as “Color Vision Deficiency” or CVD. Color blindness happens when you can't distinguish between colors. If you have color blindness, it means you see colors differently than most people. Most of the time, color blindness makes it hard to tell the difference between certain colors. Usually color blindness runs in families. You can also have color blindness as a result of disease or injury to your retina. It can impair tasks such as choosing clothing, and reading traffic lights.",
      "Color detecting neurons are located in the retina of the eye in parts called “cones”. These cones are essentially photopigment detectors and help people to interpret the colors of the objects they are viewing. That information is then sent to the brain via the optic nerve so that our brain can tell us what color an object is.If one or more of these cones in your retina is damaged or isn’t present, you’ll have difficulty seeing colors properly. Many people who have color blindness will see an object as one color, while the majority of the population sees the object as a different color or it’s true color. A person may not even know they have a color vision deficiency unless they receive an eye exam with specific vision testing for colors.",

    infos: [
      "Red-Green Blindness - This is the most common color deficiency. In the cells that detect color pigments, the red cone or the green cone has lost its function or only has limited function. Red, orange, and yellow colors will appear greener than they actually are.",
      "Blue Blindness - This is a more rare vision deficiency. The blue cones that detect blue pigments in the retina of the eye are either missing or have a limited function. Blue will seem greener and it is hard to tell yellow and red apart from pink.",
      "Blue-Yellow Blindness - People with this type of CVD lack blue cone cells. Blue will appear violet or light grey. This is a very rare type of vision deficiency.",
      "Complete Color Vision Blindness - Although rare, there are some people who don’t see color at all. Their vision is clear and results when 2 of the 3 cone cells don’t work. There is a red, blue, and green cone for photopigments in the eye. At least 2 of these 3 will fail to work, resulting in complete color vision blindness.",

      "Color Blind Test - Color blindness can be detected using few tests one among them being Ishihara color test. Ishihara color test: This color blind test detects red-green color blindness by simply visualizing a series of circles made with dots of different colors and sizes. This website makes use of this method for detecting color blindness. This test includes several online questions that show specially designed pictures made of colored dots that have numbers or shapes in a different color hidden in them. If a person has a color vision deficiency, he or she will find it difficult or impossible to see some of the patterns in the dots. To individuals who are color-blind, the plates look like just a group of dots; they cannot distinguish the number inside.",
      "This test is a self-assessment tool to measure type and extent of color vision deficiency. This test is for informational purposes only. If you believe you may have a color vision deficiency please consult an eye care professional. Results may vary depending on many factors including the type and quality of your device display, and operating system configuration. Before starting the test, turn off any software that may alter the screen color.To ensure accuracy of the result, remove any filtering eyewear or lenses.",
      "There’s no cure for color blindness, but special glasses and contact lenses can help. Your eye doctor can help you determine whether you might benefit from these glasses.",
